**Designing Software and Project Skills:**  
So In designing software, I focus on understanding the requirements, planning the structure, and iteratively refining the design. Working on this project, I enhanced my ability to use computational graphics concepts like lighting (ambient, diffuse, and specular) and 3D transformations. The design process included researching lighting techniques, implementing a basic framework in OpenGL, testing textures and refining the visuals based on feedback and testing. So in my openion these tactics—such as prototyping and continuous refinement—are valuable for future projects, ensuring adaptability and a user-centered approach.  

**Developing Programs and Iterative Strategies:**  
So my approach to development emphasizes modular coding, testing, and iteration. While creating the 3D scene, I employed strategies like incremental development, starting with simple lighting setups and progressively adding complexity. Moving around the shapes, messing with the trasnformation and lastly messing around with the textures making it as close to the picture as possible. Iteration in my openion was essential, allowing me to troubleshoot and enhance the scene's realism with each step. This experience has refined my coding practices, making my workflow more efficient and problem-focused.  

**Applying Computer Science to Goals:**  
So computational graphics and visualizations have equipped me with skills that directly support my academic and professional ambitions. These include practical coding experience in OpenGL, problem-solving in 3D environments, and a deeper understanding of visual representation. I believe these skills are critical for roles in game development or any field requiring interactive visual solutions.
